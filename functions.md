# Funtcions 

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.  A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).  There are 3 way you can call a function.

* When a user clicks a button 
* When it is called upon from the Javascript code 
* Automatically 

There are many advantages to using functions. A few are you are able to reuse the code, you can use the same code many times with different arguments. 
it also cleans up for files to be able to read the code more efficiently. Functions are the industry standard and should be understood from a deep level.

# Operators 
**Operators** are used to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. Operators are used to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. For example 

>Y = 5 + 5 gives Y = 10
‘+’ 
operator performs addition on two operands.

Note: ‘+’ operator can also be used to concatenate (add) strings.
Example:

>Y = "fellow" + "for" + "fellow" gives Y = "fellows for fellow"
Example:

>Y = "fellows" + 4 + "fellows" gives Y = "fellows4fellows"

The same rules apply for - x and division.

### Growth Mindset 



What is Growth mindset?

Growth mindset to me is a frame of mind that you must maintain in order to be successful whatever you wish to achieve. In a growth mindset you should believe you have the raw talent, grit and determination to succeed in anything you put your mind to. 
# How to maintain a growth mindset


- Try to envision the end result 
- Stay humble 
- Embrace the journey

# Who am I?

My name is Daniel Cornier, I live in Orlando,Florida (sunshine state!). I am a United States Marine Corps Veteran, husband and a Father of 3. Upon separating from the Marine Corps in 2015, I received my Bachelor's Degree in business and was employed in the GOV private sector for 5 years as an instructor and later became Director of training. I left the GOV/LE sector and started my tech journey in early 2020. I currently work for a saas tech startup based out of Denver, Colorado as QA software analyst. My goal for this year is to become a Jr developer for either the current company I work for or another company similar to where I am now.

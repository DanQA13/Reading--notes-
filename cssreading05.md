#  What is CCS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. As I discussed in my prior description for HTML and gave the reference of HTML being the structural part of building a house in the construction process. CSS is the process of construction where you add the paint, landscaping and all of the interior design (making it pretty).  CSS is a rule based language. A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other. here is an example below. 

`h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}`

`p {
    color: black;
}`


This code block above will produce an H1 head size red in color in font size 5em. the following p with braces after references the rest of the paragraph being in black. 

# How to add CSS
There are three differnt way to add CSS

- ### External
- ### Internal
- ### inline 

**External** styles are defined within the `<link>` element, inside the `<head>` section of an HTML page. External is the most preferred method or best way to organize your data. it may take longer but it is safer and more efficient. 

**Internal** An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
The internal style is defined inside the `<style>` element, inside the head section.

**Inline** An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

#  Wire framing and design 

Wire framing is basically a way or form of planning the layout of a website or an app. Wire framing is usually a very simple way to plan.  When you wire frame, colors and other features that usually make an app or website "pretty" are left for efficiency reasons. Wire framing can be done in many different ways .A few different ways are either by hand or sketch or using wire framing tools. More often than not, the decision to use online tools or to wireframe by hand, and the process used to get to from wireframe to code, is less related to the individual preference of the UX Designer, and much more related to what approach the particular situation requires. Here are some online tools for wire framing

#  What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.(If HTML where a construction step in building a house it would be the part where you are building the out side and all of the framing and very raw sheet rock work). In writing HTML there are certain rules, tags or syntax you have to follow in order to achieve a certain result. Attached below is a "cheat sheet" of html syntax.

#  SEMANTICS

Semantics is a way to describe what the code is doing or the purpose of the code vs just writing a piece of code that perform the same task or similar with a way to easily recognize it mFor example. 

` <h1>This is a top level heading</h1>`
    
or   

`<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;">Is this a top level heading?</span>`

Both of these lines of code perform the same task but one is more recognizable at first glance then the other. From a QA perspective this makes it a lot easier to find bugs or bad lines of code.

# Coders computer 

## These are the things I am installing:

1. Git - this is our local source control 
2. node - Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser.
3. NPM - npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them
4. eslint -  The primary reason ESLint was created was to allow developers to create their own linting rules. (Linting is the automated checking of your source code for programmatic and stylistic errors)
5. Tree - A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes

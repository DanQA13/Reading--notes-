My name is Daniel Cornier, I live in Orlando,Florida (sunshine state!). I am a United States Marine Corps Veteran, husband and a Father of 3. Upon separating from the Marine Corps in 2015, I received my Bachelor's Degree in business and was employed in the GOV private sector for 5 years as an instuctor and later became Director of training. I left the GOV/LE sector and started my tech journey in early 2020. I currently work for a saas tech startup based out of Denver, Colorado as QA software anaylst. My goal for this year is to become a Jr developer for either the current company I work for or another company similar to where I am now.

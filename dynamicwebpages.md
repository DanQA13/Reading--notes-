JavaScript is a programming language that executes on the browser. It turns static HTML web pages into interactive web pages by dynamically updating content, validating form data, controlling multimedia, animate images, and almost everything else on the web pages. Browsers execute this by using engines. Each browser has its own javascript engine.

* **Edge** - Edge uses Chromium with Blink and V8 engines.

* **Chrome** - Chrome uses V8.

* **Firefox** - Firefox uses spidermonkey.

* **Safari** - Safari uses Nitro.

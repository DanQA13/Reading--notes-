Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.  There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others. There are many different types of loops. Here is a list of the commonly used ones.  

# for loop 
*for loop condition*

**The statement1** is executed first even before executing the looping code. So, this statement is normally used to assign values to variables that will be used inside the loop.

**The statement2** is the condition to execute the loop.

**The statement3** is executed every time after the looping code is execute


# while loop
*while condition*

The “while loop” is executed as long as the specified condition is true. Inside the while loop, you should include the statement that will end the loop at some point of time. Otherwise, your loop will never end and your browser may crash.


# do while loop
*do while condtion*

The do…while loop is very similar to while loop. The only difference is that in do…while loop, the block of code gets executed once even before checking the condition.

Don't worry if this was the way you felt after reading that trust me I felt the same way. The best way to learn is to try, make mistakes and learn from them and remember [google](https://www.google.com/) is your friend!

# Revision to the cloud 

## Git

Today in our lecture and reading we learned about Git.  Git is a DVCS (Distributed Version Control system) A DVCS is basically a system that allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily placed on the server to replace any lost information. With the absence of backups all data will be lost, except for any portions of data stored on local machines. Which brings me to my next lesson we learned today. 

## Revisions from a local machine

A challenging subject but rewarding one once the light bulb clicked on was using terminal to push updates to git hub from my local machine. I feel the most challenging part was using terminal for all my commands and getting used to it. As I continue to use terminal I get more and more familiar with it. Some advantages to working locally is Speed. Speed is one of the main advantages to local storage. Storing data on external hard drives is faster than uploading to the cloud.  You also have full control of your backups, which means better control of who accesses your data. Disconnecting the drives from the network makes your data safe from attacks.

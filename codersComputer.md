# Day 02 Coders computer 

## These are the things I am installing:

1. Git - this is our local source control 
2. node - Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser.
3. NPM - npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them
4. eslint -  The primary reason ESLint was created was to allow developers to create their own linting rules. (Linting is the automated checking of your source code for programmatic and stylistic errors)
5. Tree - A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes

## The Terminal

The terminal is the actual interface to the console that you can type and execute text based commands. Everything we installed today was utilizing the terminal. The terminal gives you a *deeper* connection with your machine and allows you to get more out of your operating system then just utilizing the user interface. The most difficult aspect of utilizing terminal is memorizing or learning all the commands. Here is a "cheat sheet" that I use during my learning curve [markdown cheat sheet](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/mac-terminal-commands-cheat-sheet/)

## Choosing the right text editor for you 

When choosing the right text editor there are a lot of things to consider. A few of those things to think about is your level or experience in coding, extensibility
and ergonomics. Your level of coding is important in choosing a text editor because of the type of tools (extensions) you will be using, such as spell check or prettier to help make your job much easier. Ergonomics (how easy or simple it is to use) of the text editor. An ergonomic editor is one that reduces the friction in writing code. If at any point you find yourself bogged down by the text editor then it may be time to reconsider a new text editor.
